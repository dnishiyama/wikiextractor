Guus Kroonen also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, compare {{noncog|se|ga\u0111fe||female stoat}} and {{noncog|hu|h\u00f6lgy||stoat; lady, bride}} from {{noncog|urj-pro|*k\u00e4\u010fw\u00e4||female (of a fur animal)}}.\nRelated to {{cog|sco|cat}}, {{cog|fy|kat}}, {{cog|frr|k\u00e5t}} and {{m|frr|kaat}}, {{cog|nl|kat}}, {{cog|da|kat}}, {{cog|no|katt}}, {{cog|sv|katt}}, {{cog|nds-de|Katt}} and {{m|nds-de|Katte}}, {{cog|de|Katze}}, {{cog|gsw|Chatz}}, {{cog|is|k\u00f6ttur}}, {{cog|af|kat}}, {{cog|la|cattus}}, {{cog|fr|chat}}, {{cog|nrf|cat}}, {{cog|oc|cat}}, {{cog|pt|gato}}, {{cog|es|gato}}, {{cog|rup|c\u00e3tush}}, {{cog|gd|cat}}, {{cog|ga|cat}}, {{cog|br|kazh}}, {{cog|cy|cath}}, {{cog|kw|kath}}, as well as {{cog|grc|\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1}}, {{cog|el|\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1}}, and from the same ultimate source {{cog|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0442}}, {{cog|uk|\u043a\u0456\u0442}}, {{cog|be|\u043a\u043e\u0442}}, {{cog|pl|kot}}, {{cog|csb|k\u00f2t}}, {{cog|lt|kat\u0117}}, and more distantly {{cog|hy|\u056f\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0582}}, {{cog|eu|katu}}, {{cog|he|\u05d7\u05ea\u05d5\u05dc|tr=khat\u00fal}}, {{cog|ar|\u0642\u0650\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0629}} alongside dialectal Maghrebi Arabic {{m|ar|\u0642\u064e\u0637\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0633}} (from Berber, probably from Latin).\n{{rel-bottom}}", "noun": ["An animal of the family Felidae", "A person", "{{lb|en|nautical}} A strong tackle used to hoist an anchor to the cathead of a ship", "{{lb|en|chiefly|nautical}}  cat-o'-nine-tails", "{{lb|en|archaic}} A sturdy merchant sailing vessel {{qualifier|now only in \"catboat\"}}", "{{lb|en|archaic|uncountable}} The game of \"trap and ball\" (also called \"cat and dog\")", "{{lb|en|archaic}} The pointed piece of wood that is struck in the game of tipcat", "{{lb|en|slang|vulgar|African American Vernacular English}} A vagina, a vulva; the female external genitalia", "A double tripod (for holding a plate, etc.) with six feet, of which three rest on the ground, in whatever position it is placed", "{{lb|en|historical}} A wheeled shelter, used in the Middle Ages as a siege weapon to allow assailants to approach enemy defences"], "verb": ["{{lb|en|nautical|transitive}} To hoist (the anchor) by its ring so that it hangs at the cathead", "{{lb|en|nautical|transitive}} To flog with a cat-o'-nine-tails", "{{lb|en|slang}} To vomit something", "To go wandering at night", "To gossip in a catty manner"]}, {"noun": ["{{abbreviation of|en|catamaran}}", "{{en-noun}}", "{{lb|en|computing}} A program and command in Unix that reads one or more files and directs their content to the standard output"], "etymology": "Abbreviation of \"catenate\".", "verb": ["{{lb|en|computing|transitive}} To apply the cat command to (one or more files)", "{{lb|en|computing|slang}} To dump large amounts of data on (an unprepared target) usually with no intention of browsing it carefully"]}, {"etymology": "Possibly a shortened form of {{m|en|catastrophic}}.", "adjective": ["{{lb|en|Ireland|informal}} Terrible, disastrous"]}, {"etymology": "Shortened from {{m|en|methcathinone}}.", "noun": []}, {"etymology": "Shortened from {{m|en|catapult}}.", "noun": ["{{lb|en|military|naval}} A catapult"]}, {"noun": ["{{abbreviation of|en|category}}", "{{en-noun}}", "{{abbreviation of|en|catfish}}", "{{en-noun}}", "{{lb|en|slang}} Any of a variety of earth-moving machines.
